# Electricity Consumption Analysis: Python & Tableau
## üîπ Overview
This project explores electricity consumption trends using Python for data analysis and Tableau for visualization. We examine how energy demand has changed over time, calculate Year-over-Year (YoY) growth, and assess how residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Transportation sectors contribute to total revenue, identify growth patterns, and use forecasting techniques to redict future electricity demands. 


## Python
Dataset Summary
The dataset contains electricity sales data across four key sectors:
‚úî Residential
‚úî Commercial
‚úî Industrial
‚úî Transportation

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Before analysis, I:
‚úÖ Removed unnecessary headers and missing values
‚úÖ Converted columns to numerical types
‚úÖ Calculated Year-over-Year (YoY) growth
‚úÖ Computed sector contribution percentages

### Python for Data & Exploratory Analysis


### Forecasting Future Electricity Demand With Prophet
To predict energy trends for the next 10 years, I applied Facebook Prophet in Python:

Key Forecasting Takeaways:
‚úî Electricity demand is projected to grow, with Commercial leading the expansion.
‚úî Industrial sector remains volatile, reflecting economic uncertainty.
‚úî Transportation demand will rise, driven by EV adoption and infrastructure growth.

## Tableau
To summarize insights, I built a KPI dashboard with three key indicators:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Electricity Sales (GWh) ‚Äì Displays total energy consumption per year.
2Ô∏è‚É£ YoY Growth (%) ‚Äì Highlights whether electricity demand is rising or falling.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Largest Contributing Sector ‚Äì Identifies which sector contributes the most to overall revenue.
